# 10-days-of-code-1
10 days of writing code everyday. 

### Description
The project I focused on in the 10 Days of Code is automating a data extraction and entry process. The task is to log the check-in and check-out details of members in a Slack team in a Google Sheet. For ten days, I worked on this task and the final product was finished on Day 7. 

I used regular expressions to extract the relevant details from text copied from Slack and output a csv file which can then be opened in Excel and copied straight to the Google Sheet. Instead of laboriously copying and pasting one string of text after another, I reduced the work involved by about 90 percent by doing a single massive copy into the Jupyter notebook, fixing relevant bugs, and copying the csv into Google Sheets. 

On some other days of the Ten Days of Code, I solved some Hackerrank problems.
